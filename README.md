# ALL DAY ALL LIFE
Ever wanted to run the pipes.sh, cmatrix, etc on your screen but then you realised that you need to setup WSL for that because you are a windows user which you think might take time. That is why, I have made this project named **All Day All Life** which contains not only a replica of those scripts but also a to do list, a file manager, an auto clicker, etc.

## Installation
To use this program, you will need to have the following dependencies installed:

- os
- keyboard    => ```pip install keyboard```
- time
- random
- ctypes
- sys
- platform
- subprocess
- pynput      => ```pip install pynput```

## Running it
To run the program, simply execute the main_program.py file:

```python main_program.py```

This will launch the main menu, where you can select from various options such as "About", "To-do List", "Terminal", "File Manager", "DVD", "Pipes", "Matrix", and "Auto Clicker".
